# smartSimulation
Simulation showing an application of reinforcement learning methods on an intelligent agent. The robot using machine learning algorithms,
learns about the environment, and based either on a prize or a punishment tries to reach the goal in the most optimal way.

Algorithm used: Q-learning using epsilon-greedy policy.

Run using gradle:

(linux):$./gradlew run 

(windows):$ gradlew.bat

the result is saved in the data.xls file in assets folder
