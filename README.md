# smartSimulation
Simulates an agent that uses reinforcement learning methods to discover the most optimal behaviour. The robot using machine learning algorithms learns about the environment and based either on a prize or a punishment tries to reach the goal in the most optimal way.

Algorithm used: Q-learning using epsilon-greedy policy.

Run using gradle:

(linux):$./gradlew run 

(windows):$ gradlew.bat run

the result is saved in the data.xls file in assets folder
